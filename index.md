## **The NaWaCC project**

The NaWaCC project is a three-year project funded by the French and the German research agencies (the [ANR](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/) and the [DFG](http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp)). Its budget amounts to 385,978€. The project started in May 2018 and will end in October 2021. 


### Summary

France and Germany are two major countries of immigration in Europe. In 2010, foreign-born individuals represented 7.2% and 6.3% of their respective population. Although the economic situation in France and Germany differs a lot in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis (including different dynamics regarding inequality and unemployment) the recent increase in asylum demands and illegal immigration has raised a vivid debate on the strictness of immigration policies in both countries. The economic consequences of immigration, especially for native workers, are at the centre of this debate. 

In three scientific work-packages, this project will investigate the impact of immigrant workers on natives’ jobs and wages. We will go beyond the existing literature by investigating why the impact of immigrants varies across countries. 


* ***Work-package 1.** Labour market effects of immigrants, task allocation and production strategies*
<br/> We will explore the mechanism underlying the labour market effects of immigrants by focusing on task allocation and production strategies within and across firms.


* ***Work-package 2.** Trade integration, immigration and wages: micro mechanisms and aggregate implications*
<br/> We will investigate to what extent the impact of immigrants on natives’ wages is conditioned by trade integration. We will devote a special attention to the aggregate consequences of firm-level dynamics.


* ***Work-package 3.** Political determinants of immigration policy toward different groups of immigrants in the European Union*
<br/> We will investigate what determines immigration policies toward different types of immigrants across European countries. We will analyse the interplays between immigration policies and labour market outcomes.
