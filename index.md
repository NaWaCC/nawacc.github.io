## The NaWaCC project

NaWaCC project -- How Immigration Impacts **Na**tives' **Wa**ges: Investigating **C**ross-**C**ountry Differences -- is a three-year project funded by the French and the German research agencies (the [ANR](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/) and the [DFG](http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp)). The project will start on May 1, 2018. 

The aim of the project is to **understand and quantify the impact of immigration on natives' wages in a context of globalisation**.

### Summary

France and Germany are two major countries of immigration in Europe. In 2010, foreign-born individuals represented 7.2% and 6.3% of their respective population. Although the economic situation in France and Germany differs a lot in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis (including different dynamics regarding inequality and unemployment) the recent increase in asylum demands and illegal immigration has raised a vivid debate on the strictness of immigration policies in both countries. The economic consequences of immigration, especially for native workers, are at the centre of this debate. 

In three scientific work-packages, this project will investigate the impact of immigrant workers on natives’ jobs and wages. We will go beyond the existing literature by investigating why the impact of immigrants varies across countries. 

**1. Labour market effects of immigrants, task allocation and production strategies**   :fr:  :de:
*Aim*: Explore the mechanism underlying the labour market effects of immigrants by focusing on task allocation and production strategies within and across firms.

**2. Trade integration, immigration and wages: micro mechanisms and aggregate implications** :fr:  :de:
*Aim*: Investigate to what extent the impact of immigrants on natives’ wages is conditioned by trade integration. Devote a special attention to aggregate consequences of firm-level dynamics.

**3. Political determinants of immigration policy toward different groups of immigrants in the European Union**  :de:
*Aim*: Investigate what determines immigration policies toward different types of immigrants across European countries. Analyse the interplays between immigration policies and labour market outcomes.
